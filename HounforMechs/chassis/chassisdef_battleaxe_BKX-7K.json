    "Details": "The prototype of the BattleAxe originally appeared in 2459, and relied on the standard armament of the time: lasers and missiles. Over the next fifteen years, the speed was increased by a third and the mass of the cockpit and armor were reduced. In the late 2460s, unsure of the BattleAxe's maneuverability, the introduction of the WSP-1 Wasp inspired designers to mount experimental jump jets onto the upper legs, allowing it to vault over anything it could not run through. Unfortunately, MechWarriors had to go through training for the new jump jets and the landing process, as many died early on. The Federated Suns subsequently switched the Large Lasers in the arms for new Particle Projection Cannons. The BattleAxe only has nine tons of armor, which is comparatively light for a 'Mech of its size. Massive overheating problems, and the introduction of the Hammerhands, eventually ended the operational service of the BattleAxe.",

  "YangsThoughts": "Well well, very interesting. You should know that the last original chassis of this type was considered destroyed in the defense of Robinson back during the Second Succession War, but it looks like very few 'Mechs managed to survive. I wouldn't dare to go into battle with a 70-ton 'Mech protected only by nine tons of armor, but I must admit that BattleAxe, as one of the predecessors of the legendary Warhammer, is well-armed. It also has jump jets, so might not be bad as a mobile sniper.",
