    "Details": "The Phoenix was the Rim Worlds Republic's first effort to design a jump-capable BattleMech designed and produced by Krauss-Liemann Incorporated. Terens Amaris was convinced that the Wasp and its jump jets heralded a sea-change in tactics and was determined to build a 'Mech larger than the Wasp that incorporated them. Unfortunately, the Republic lacked jump jets, so the project stalled while technicians reverse-engineered the technology. No other power produced or salvaged the Phoenix and it was believed to have become extinct following Aleksandr Kerensky's conquest of the Rim Worlds Republic.",

As you can see, not quite â€“ several copies have survived to this day. Not a bad machine: it has good armor, cooling and mobility, but there are problems with the design of the legs, besides, the armament for fifty tons should be more powerful. And maintaining it these days isn't easy either.",
