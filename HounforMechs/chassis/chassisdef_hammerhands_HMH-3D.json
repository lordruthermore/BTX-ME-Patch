    "Details": "The second exclusive Federated Suns BattleMech, the Hammerhands was developed in 2475 after a decade reviewing the performance and complaints received about the earlier BattleAxe. Little more than a heavier and slower version of the BattleAxe, the design received its name based on the impressive weapons carried in each arm, serving to trigger the Federated Suns' seeming love affair with autocannons. Much like its sibling design, the Hammerhands went on to influence and be outdone by the immensely popular Warhammer, causing it to fade into history, all but forgotten.",

Hammerhands got its name for its main armament: two Mydron Model B AC/10 autocannons, one for each arm. Additional armament is represented by two ChisComp 38 Medium Lasers paired with the cannons, as well as a Harpoon-6 SRM-6 launcher on the right shoulder. The 'Mech carries three jump jets and eleven and a half tons of armor. Its main drawback is its top speed of 54 km/h.",
