It was a testament to the Earthwerks designs that so many survived and were so ubiquitous even throughout that destructive time. The Thug design was probably when Earthwerks perfected their chassis but some of the earlier chassis designs also benefitted from Earthwerk's ability to make a durable 'Mech.",
